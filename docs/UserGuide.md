## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for EduManage.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar EduManage.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/99999999 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

### Notes on the Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Names with multiple spaces are treated as if they contain a single space, and names are not case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. `alex yeoh` and `Alex  yeoh` are the same as `Alex Yeoh`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SUBJECT]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/MATH` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SUBJECT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/MATH`, `s/MATH s/PHYSICS` etc.<br>
  e.g. `[lt/LESSON_TIME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `lt/SUN-11:00-13:00`, `lt/SUN-11:00-13:00 lt/WED-17:00-19:00` etc.

* `lt/LESSON_TIME` must follow the format:`lt/day-start-end`<br>
  e.g. `lt/SUN-13:00-15:00`
  * Acceptable values for `day` are `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`, `SUN`.
  * `start` must be in `HH:MM`, `HH` must be between 0 and 23 inclusive, `MM` must be between 0 and 59 inclusive.
  * `end` must be in `HH:MM`, `HH` must be between 0 and 23 inclusive, `MM` must be between 0 and 59 inclusive, and `end` must be later than `start`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the Data

EduManage data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

***

### Editing the Data File

EduManage data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduManage will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the EduManage to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduManage home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
